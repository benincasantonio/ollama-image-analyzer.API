# Ollama APIs

This project provides a Flask-based API for image description using the Ollama model. The API allows users to upload an image and receive a description generated by the model.

You can use this frontend project to interact with the API: [Ollama Image Analyzer](https://github.com/benincasantonio/ollama-image-analyzer)
